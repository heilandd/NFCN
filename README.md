This algorithm identifies the nearest connected cell from a base and a target data set with respect to a defined receptor-ligand pair. 
Data should be in a defined format: expression matrices with cells as colon names and genes as down names, of base cells and target pupulation respectively.

## How to install the package from GitHub

Install in Mac/Linux
Requirements: 

Xcode Command Line Tools or other C++ Compiler
R-Software (https://cran.r-project.org)

```
git clone https://github.com/heilandd/NFCN

cd NFCN

#Example:
Rscript NFCN.R --help

```

#Input Parameter: 

--Ligand: A string of the ligand genes. Example: IL10
--Receptor: A string of the receptor genes. Example: IL10RA,IL10RB
--Gensets: GeneSets: 
            first row: Genes Induction (a geneSet that is responsible to induce the ligand expression)
            second row: Genes Response (a geneSet that respond to a ligand activation)
 --Matrix_basis: Gene Expression Matrix with cells as colnames and rawnames as rownames
 --Matrix_target: Gene Expression Matrix with cells as colnames and rawnames as rownames
 --DimRed: Matrix of Dimensional reduction of your cells (UMAP//TSNE...)
 --Output: Output Folder
 --quantil_test: Which quantil of connected cells should be used for further anaysis Default=0.8
 --VisLabOutput: Return a Output of DE for VisLab Default=F (if T->  adapt --quantil_test to more than 0.9)


In any case of problems send me the Error per mail.

### Tutorial and Examples

In the following section we show an example how you can use NFCN on you MAC/Linux (until now: Windows is not suported). First clone the github and install requirements. A RDS file containing all requirements is given in the folder requirements. The script install.R contains a function to run automaticly install all packages. 


#### Open your Terminal:

```
Rscript install.R

```

Next, we select the data that we like to analyze. First a set of cells that reflect your basline cells. The algorithm uses this set of cells and look for connected cells of your target dataset. In other words, you filter a distinct subset of cells you are interested in and look for connected cells in the rest of your dataset. We need two gene expression matrizes where colnames reflect cells (if cells overlap between datasets you will end up with errors) and rownames are HUGO symbols. 

Further, we look at a defined biological process, therefore we need to collect information regarding down- and up- stream activations. This information is sometimes hard to aquire but an essencial part of your success. For Example: 

We check the pair IFNG and IFNGR1 & IFNGR2, then we need a set of genes, which describe induction if IFNG (by the releaser cell) and IFNG response (by the receiver cell). Data need to be in a table where the first col contain induction genes and the second row contain response genes. Sometimes geneSets overlap (this will not create errors). 

| Induction  | Response    
| ---------- |:---------:| 
| IFNAR1     | ADAR      | 
| IFNAR2     | APOL6     |  
| NFKB1      | CCL2      |    
| JUN        | CD274     |
| IRF1       | CXCL9     |
|  ...       | ...       |

If you want to plot connections into your TSNE//UMAP, provide a table with Dim1 and Dim2 (HUGO genes as rownames). If you use seurat you can export the DimRed by: 

```
write.table(yourseurat@reductions$umap@cell.embeddings, "DimRed.txt")
```
From monocle:

```
write.table(reducedDims(yourcds)[["UMAP"]], "DimRed.txt")
```

Now, you have all your data, lets run the script.


#### Open your Terminal:

```
Rscript NFCN.R --Ligand IFNG --Receptor IFNGR1,IFNGR2 --Gensets pathto/GS.txt --Matrix_basis pathto/Basis.txt --Matrix_target pathto/Target.txt --DimRed pathto/DimRed.txt


```
#### Pitfalls: 
- Never put space if you use more than one receptor, allways use a "," to seperate.
- Expression matrix, use the write.table() function from R to export
