This algorithm identifies the nearest connected cell from a base and a target data set with respect to a defined receptor-ligand pair. 
Data should be in a defined format: expression matrices with cells as colon names and genes as down names, of base cells and target pupulation respectively.

## How to install the package from GitHub

Install in Mac/Linux
Requirements: 

Xcode Command Line Tools or other C++ Compiler
R-Software (https://cran.r-project.org)

```
git clone https://github.com/heilandd/NFCN

cd NFCN

#Example:
Rscript NFCN.R --help

```

#Input Parameter: 

--Ligand: A string of the ligand genes. Example: IL10
--Receptor: A string of the receptor genes. Example: IL10RA,IL10RB
--Gensets: GeneSets: 
            first row: Genes Induction (a geneSet that is responsible to induce the ligand expression)
            second row: Genes Response (a geneSet that respond to a ligand activation)
 --Matrix_basis: Gene Expression Matrix with cells as colnames and rawnames as rownames
 --Matrix_target: Gene Expression Matrix with cells as colnames and rawnames as rownames
 --DimRed: Matrix of Dimensional reduction of your cells (UMAP//TSNE...)
 --Output: Output Folder
 --quantil_test: Which quantil of connected cells should be used for further anaysis Default=0.8
 --VisLabOutput: Return a Output of DE for VisLab Default=F (if T->  adapt --quantil_test to more than 0.9)
